        <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
           <p> My name is Iulia. I am 18 years old, and I live in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
           <p> I was born on March 25, 2002, so I am a crazy, ambitious Aries with many dreams and hopes.</p>
           <p> I play piano and guitar, I am a Shutterstock contributor, and I love taking photos and creating photo manipulations. I am also super curious when it comes to sciences. I am open-minded, so I want to learn and try lots of things.</p>

        <h3>WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?</h3>
           <p> In the first place, I made this blog to keep myself motivated and active. I want to track my progress and keep a history of every journey I start. I'd love to inspire and show you what steps to follow to achieve new goals and dreams. I really wish my blogs, feelings, and experiences to guide you like a map and make you feel happy, motivated, and inspired. </p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>WHY SHOULD YOU FOLLOW ME?</h3>
           <p> If you feel like you resonate with me, if we have common passions and goals, you should definitely follow me. I'll give you my best tips and tricks so you will have a super strong mindset and stop procrastinating. My steps will guide you, so you'll know very well how to approach a new skill, start a new journey and stay motivated until you achieve your dreams.</p>
           <p>That being said, let's rise together.</p>
